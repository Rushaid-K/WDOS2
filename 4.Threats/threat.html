            <h2 class="problem">Habitat loss and degradation: Turtles rely on specific habitats, such as beaches for nesting and shallow coastal waters for feeding, but these habitats are increasingly under threat from development, pollution, and other human activities</h2>
            <h2 class="solution">Solution: Protecting and restoring critical turtle habitats, such as beaches, coral reefs, and seagrass beds, through conservation programs, land-use planning, and sustainable development practices</h2>

                <h2 class="problem">Overexploitation and hunting: Turtles are often hunted for their meat, eggs, and shells, which are used in traditional medicines and decorative items. This has led to declines in turtle populations and even extinction in some cases.</h2>
                <h2 class="solution">Enforcing laws and regulations that prohibit the hunting, poaching, and trafficking of turtles and their products, and promoting alternative livelihoods for communities that rely on turtle harvesting</h2>

                <h2 class="problem3">Climate change: Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns are affecting the distribution of sea turtles' prey and nesting sites, which can have a significant impact on their survival. In addition, warming oceans can affect the sex ratio of turtle hatchlings, leading to fewer males and a reduced ability to reproduce.</h2>
                <h2 class="solution3">Mitigating the impacts of climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting strategies that promote resilience in turtle populations, such as protecting and restoring habitats, promoting genetic diversity, and reducing other stressors such as pollution and overfishing. Additionally, measures such as nest relocation and shading can help to offset the impacts of warming temperatures on turtle hatchlings.</h2>
